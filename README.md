# Image-Segmentation-For-Drones

Our custom dataset contains a total of 48 images of obstacles and stations that were used to implement the approach where at first, images were patchified into smaller images, and then the model was trained on large datasets. To evaluate which model performance for prediciting each class is better IoU were used.
